Version: 0.1 (pre-pre-alpha)

CoPhiProofReader is a webapplication to assist proof readers of Ancient Greek
and Latin classical editions.
Inspared by hocr Editor plugin for Firex, 
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hocr-editor,
the image is split in text lines followed by the related editable OCR output.
Colors indicate if a word is recognized by the spellchecker (black),
not recognized due to accent issues (grey),
not recognized but a well formed syllabic sequence (blue)
or, finally, a bad sequence of characters.

Clicking on the words, a list box shows the suggestions of the spell-checker
and of the alignment with another edition, if provided (not in the current demo).

The current hocr parsed by this application is NOT STANDARD. It is based on
a proprietary nidification of <span/> tags with some proprietary attributes.
Next version will be compliant with the hocr microformat specifications,
according to this document:
https://docs.google.com/document/preview?id=1QQnIQtvdAC_8n92-LhwPcjtAUFwBlzE8EWnKAxlgVf0

The Latin spellchecker has not yet plugged in, so currently all Latin words are
classified as errors.

This version is just a demo: one static .html file and the related image
are statically uploaded and changes are not saved.
